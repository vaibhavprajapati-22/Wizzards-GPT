Project Description -
<br>
This project aims to solve the inefficiency and complexity of extracting information from text-based documents in various formats such as .txt, .doc, and .pdf. These documents often contain valuable information, but finding and understanding that information can be time-consuming and challenging.
<br>
Efficient Information Retrieval: The custom chatbot/GPT-powered system streamlines the process of accessing information within documents. Users can upload a document and ask questions, eliminating the need to search through lengthy texts manually.
<br>
Quick and Clear Responses: The system generates crisp and clear responses to user queries. This ensures that users receive the information they need straightforwardly and understandably, saving them time and effort.
<br>
Handling Multiple Documents: Users can process multiple input documents simultaneously. This feature is valuable for users who must cross-reference information from multiple sources or work with large documents.
<br>
Content Credibility: The system can highlight or provide source references from the input documents. This helps users trust the information they receive, as they can verify it within the context of the original documents.
Faster Response Times: Prioritizing faster response times as a key performance indicator ensures that users get quick answers to their queries. This is especially important when time is of the essence.
<br>
The system maintains a chat history for reference, allowing users to revisit previous interactions and information, enhancing their overall experience.
